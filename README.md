presentation slides in the format 16:9. The template provides different options to change its visual aspect as well as shows examples
of exposing images, tables, and bibliography references.

## Disclaimer

This project is a personal initiative, under open source and collaborative principles, which until now has no formal association with the Federal University of Goiás institution. Thus, this template is not an official artifact from such a university.
